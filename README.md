# 👋 Hey, I'm Fiyin! /fee-yeen/

Welcome to my little corner of GitHub 👩🏽‍💻✨

I'm a Systems Design Engineering student at the University of Waterloo — which basically means I like to build cool things, break them (accidentally), and then figure out how to make them better. I dabble in all sorts of areas: CAD, coding, design, and occasionally, overthinking how to name my folders.

## 🌱 A few things about me:
- I love turning messy ideas into something real — whether it's a SolidWorks model, a tiny website, or a half-working prototype that I'm weirdly proud of.
- Big fan of learning by doing (and Googling... a lot).
- I’m passionate about making tech more inclusive and human-centered.
- I’m the kind of person who puts “fun fact” in a presentation and immediately forgets anything interesting I’ve ever done.

## 💻 Currently Exploring:
- CAD tools like SolidWorks and Fusion 360.
- React, JavaScript, and a bit of Node.js when I’m feeling brave.
- UX/UI design, because good design should never be an afterthought.

## 🎭 Two Truths and a Lie:
- I can solve a Rubik’s Cube in under a minute.
- I don't drink coffee during exams. At all.
- I fully believe Ctrl+Z should exist in real life.

Take a guess! 👀
